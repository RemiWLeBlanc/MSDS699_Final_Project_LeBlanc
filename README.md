# Predicting Forest Fires
Predicting burned areas of forest fires using Machine Learning with scikitlearn.

This data has some major outliers, large fires, that makes it an interesting data set to model. The large fires are ones we would like to predict well.

I attempted several different models and finalized a Random Forest Regressor to predict burn area in hectares. 

Being able to predict fires and determine which features are most predictive can be very useful. Due to climate change forest fires may be a major issue in the future. My experience living in California in 2020 convinced me the importance of creating a model to predict the burn area of fires.
